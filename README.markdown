## Overview

Each six-week session, all students in modules 2, 3, and 4 will give one five-minute lightning talk to their peers. Lightning talk preparation should take approximately 3-6 hours. **If you are in module 4, you have the option of leading/teaching a 1-hour student-led session on Friday in place of giving a final lightning talk.**

## Schedule

During intermission week, submit a pull request for that module's markdown file and add your topic. Topic choices will be first-come, first-served. 

During the week of your lighting talk, the schedule will be as follows:

* **Monday**: Submit your topic to the markdown file  **before 4pm**. 
* **Tuesday**: Add your outline as a gist **before 4pm**. Please don't make us hunt you down!
* **Wednesday**: Draft slides and/or content for presentation. You do not need to submit anything.
* **Thursday**: Rehearsal in Classroom C after wrap up. Your slides and content should be prepared in advance as laptops will be closed during rehearsal. Attendance is mandatory.
* **Friday**: Present your 5-minute talk for your Turing peers. 

## Topics & Themes

**Module 2 students**: Your topic can either be tech-related OR related to your background before coming to Turing.

**Module 3 and 4 students**: Your topic should fit into one of the themes below:

* Computer Hardware
* Computer Science
* Design / User Experience
* DevOps
* Front End Development
* General Software Methodologies / Techniques
* Historical or Present-day People in Computer Science
* JavaScript Architecture / Libraries
* Programming & Science
* Programming & the Arts
* Programming Languages
* Ruby Architecture / Libraries
* Software Libraries
* Software Testing
* Technology & Law
* Technology & Society
* Technology & Ethics
* Web Technologies

When considering the content of your presentation, take care to promote a welcoming environment for all students regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic background, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. 

## Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.
